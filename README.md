# Encipher
Encrypting (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called ciphertext) back into the original message (generally called plaintext).

"A key, for example, might be the string NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB. This 26-character key means that A (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into N (the first character of the key), B (the second letter of the alphabet) should be converted into Q (the second character of the key), and so forth"

# Aims of Project:
Explore cryptography methodolgy using: 

- A key taken from the user as a command-line argument

- Arrays

- Nested for loops

- User Defined Functions

- ASCII values

- isupper(), tolower() functions etc. 


# Learning Outcomes: 
- Improved understanding of low level details on how characters mapped in a computers memory
- Utilised ASCII values by manipulating them in a fundamental way in order to map and encipher correct characters to each other  
- Improved understanding of Pass-By-Reference by passing arrays into functions 
- Affirmed understanding isupper() toupper() functions
- Improved implementation of robust error checking
